  This license describes how you, the user, may use Jake's Build Tools (henceforth referred to as "JBT") and related assets. This license is subject to change by maybejake, the owner, at any time.

B. Allowed Uses

  1. You may play with JBT in any form on any singleplayer or multiplayer server you choose.

  2. You may edit JBT and its assets for your own personal use, so long as you do not redistribute said edited content publicly. This does not apply to edited content that is sufficiently distinguishable as original and distinct from JBT content and that does not break any of the rest of this license.

    For example:
    - You are allowed to create an edited version without all features you dislike for personal use. You are not allowed to redistribute it.
    - You are allowed to use a personal edited version on your own private server.
    - You are allowed to create a "JBT but I made the trowel look like a magic wand" addon resource pack and redistribute it.

  3. You may create and share your own JBT-related content, such as videos, fanart, and images so long as you do not charge for said content and it does not redistribute JBT or any of its assets.

    For example:
    - You are allowed to create a video series of your gameplay.
    - You are not allowed to create JBT merchandise and charge for it.
  
  4. You may include JBT in a public modpack or datapack compilation without explicit permission from the owner. However, credit must be given in some form.
  
	For example:
	- You are allowed to use JBT in a fabric or neoforge modpack.
	- You are allowed to use JBT in a compilation of multiple datapacks. 
	- You are not allowed to fuse JBT with multiple other datapacks to create a single, giant, public datapack.


C. Denied Uses

  1. You may not redistribute JBT or any of its assets. This does not apply to simple mcfunction concepts. You are free to read JBT code and use it to learn.

    i. You may not use any of JBT's resource pack assets for your own projects.

      For example:
      - You are not allowed to take JBT's trowel texture and create your own trowel data pack using it.
      - You are not allowed to make JBT NFTs.

    ii. You may not use JBT's mcfunction code for your own projects. However, as noted above, this does not apply to simple, sufficiently generic mcfunction concepts.

      For example:
      - You may use simple concepts such as randomization techniques and use them in your own data pack.
      - You may not take all of the code for trowel and chisel block placement system and redistribute it in your own data pack.

  2. You may not pass off JBT or its assets as your own. Give proper credit where it is due.


D. Exceptions 

  1. It should be clear that all members of JBT's development team are exempt from any part of the above license at any time, for any reason, given their ownership of the content in question.
